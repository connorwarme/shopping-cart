ideas for improvement // objectives
- fonts? would add a bunch of character
- text content on Home? "ATHLETE / DIETICIAN" then one line athlete mantra, one line nutrition philosophy..?
- when you click "Add to Cart", it'd be cool to have a little pop-up: "Successfully added to cart" w/ option to view cart
---> another idea - just change the text to a green check mark for 1s then back to normal...
- add some text or logo for when the cart is empty...
