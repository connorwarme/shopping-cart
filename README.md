![homepage](https://github.com/connorwarme/shopping-cart/blob/main/screenshots/home-full.png?raw=true "homepage preview")  
  
## objectives  
* utilize React, with Test Driven Development (via Jest)  
* implement a products page: all items listed, option to view or add to cart  
* on product page: option to change quantity  
* on cart page: option to change quantity, or to remove from cart  
* serve as a mockup site for Amity (my wife), as she'll need a site as a pro athlete and certified dietician  
* dynamically update photographer credit w/ each page change  
* style for desktop and for mobile  
  
## reflections  
* I enjoy working with React!  
* went for a simple / sleek interface and less text but w/ cool photos  
* added visual confirmation when item is added to cart, or not!  
* learned how to scale down photo file sizes  
  
## screenshots  
* full site version:  
![about](https://github.com/connorwarme/shopping-cart/blob/main/screenshots/about-full.png?raw=true "about")  
![packages](https://github.com/connorwarme/shopping-cart/blob/main/screenshots/packages-full.png?raw=true "packages")  
![cart](https://github.com/connorwarme/shopping-cart/blob/main/screenshots/cart-full.png?raw=true "cart")  
  
* mobile version:  
![home](https://github.com/connorwarme/shopping-cart/blob/main/screenshots/home-mobile.png?raw=true "home")  
![about](https://github.com/connorwarme/shopping-cart/blob/main/screenshots/aboutA-mobile.png?raw=true "about")

![cart](https://github.com/connorwarme/shopping-cart/blob/main/screenshots/cart-mobile.png?raw=true "cart")  
  
## improvements  
* add transitions for when user clicks on mobile menu icon + link  
* add error message when user tries to exceed quantity maximum for given item  
* open to suggestions - let me know!  
  
  
  
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
